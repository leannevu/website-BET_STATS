As I transition from Computer Science to Data Science, I decided to take a more analytical approach with my full stack projects involving database management. I used Python (Flask, Matplotlib, Pandas) in Bet Stats to populate charts and graphs in real time, as players play (saving outcome results, number of times played, date played, etc. into the database)

# website-BET_STATS
Interactive Drawing Card Game with Analytics

As a user, I want the option to play the game, save my outcomes/balance/profile with the game, and see game insights

Epic 
As a user drawing 2 cards from a deck of cards, I can place a bet and win 20 times the amount if the two cards share the same face value

     Story
     As a user, my balance is updated everytime I draw the two cards from a stack
     As a user, I am forced to stop when I've drawn all cards from the same stack
     As a user, I can stop whenever I want and my results will be saved into the database

Epic
As a user, I want to see game or player insights
     Story
     As a user, I can see Wins vs. Losses per player
     As a user, I can see the Outcome Distribution
     As a user, I see the Total Bets Per Player as a pie chart
